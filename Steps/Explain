Each website works on this:
HTTP request + HTTP response:

The HTTP request is sent by the browser to the server. The server then sends back an HTTP response
The HTTP response contains the HTML code of the website. The browser then renders the HTML code and displays
the website to the user

So if I want to login you need to get the values from the input field with JS and send these values to the server
and after that the server (flask app) do the logic and send the response
